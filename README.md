Comparing Python Libraries for Grayscale to Color Image Conversion ðŸŽ¨
ðŸ“Œ Evaluating Scikit-Image, OpenCV, Pillow, and ImageIO for Image Colorization

Project Overview
This project provides a comparative analysis of four Python librariesâ€”Scikit-Image, OpenCV, Pillow, and ImageIOâ€”for converting grayscale images to RGB (colorized) images. The evaluation is based on accuracy, computational efficiency, training loss, and ease of implementation.

Key Features
âœ” Performance Evaluation: Comparing the conversion accuracy using MSE & SSI metrics.
âœ” Computational Efficiency: Analyzing the execution time per epoch for each library.
âœ” Memory Utilization: Assessing the resource usage during image processing.
âœ” Ease of Implementation: Evaluating the simplicity of integrating each library into workflows.
âœ” Library Comparison: Providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each library.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-Image, OpenCV (cv2), Pillow, ImageIO, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Deep Learning Frameworks: Keras with TensorFlow Backend
Development Environment: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
GPU Acceleration: CUDA (if available)
